# Equation: Quadratic Formula

# Factor of the quadratic term, a
a = 1

# Factor of the linear term, b
b = 1

# Factor of the constant term, c
c = -6

# Quadratic equation solving for first root

x1 = (-b+(b**2-4*a*c)**(0.5))/(2*a)

# Quadratic equation solving for second root

x2 = (-b-(b**2-4*a*c)**(0.5))/(2*a)

# Equation: Slope of a line given two points

# Point 1, abscissa
w1 = 2

# Point 2, abscissa
w2 = 3

# Point 1, ordinate
y1 = 6

# Point 2, ordinate
y2 = 10

# Equation: Formula to calculate slope of a line given two points
m = (y2 - y1) / (w2 - w1)

#Concerns:

#~ For Class 4 assignment 2: the code is correct, it shows up correct in my terminal- but it isnt writing to my file correctly.

#~ *the index is counting by 1's at not reporting back index of where stop codons are- in my file. Correctly reported in terminal 

#~ Stop codon is not working (unless there really are none)

#~ Stop codon; I have to find them individually; if I use stopcodon = ["TAG", "TGA", "TAA"] it doesnt work.
#I got it to work at one point, but now its not :/ original coe got lost in all thi Github changes 

#~ Still don't understand the "find stop codon in frame with start codon" questions

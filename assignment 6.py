#Week 6 Assignment

Review the book chapters and tutorials on functions and classes.

1)    Convert your equations from the week 3 assignment to functions
2)    Create a class for something. It would be nice if the class were science-related. The class should contain attributes and at least one class method (i.e. function). See my Cars class as an example.
3)    Create three different instances of your class
4)    Choose a data file related to your research that you would like to parse. This file will be the basis for your final coding project.

Also, Google the term “pythonpath” to learn about it prior to class.
